# Puma, Sequel, Heroku, Connection Pool and Concurrency

How many database connections will I need?
How do I figure out connection pool size?
Consider a Heroku setup like this:

* 2 dynos (machines),
* Each of them has 4 Puma workers (processes),
* And each worker has max 10 threads.

To get the number of connections your app can eat when running at max:

* Max database connections: `2 dynos * 4 workers * 10 threads = 80 connections`

Now you need to figure out how to correctly set connection pool size so
each part has its own share but the total doesn't exceed the connection limit.
Every worker (process) has its own pool.

* Number of pools: `2 dynos * 4 workers = 8 pools in total`
* Connection pool: `10 threads = 10 connections`
* Total:           `8 pools * 10 connections = 80 connections` (to make sure)

## I want to tweak setup and pool size

If you are using Postgres Hobby Basic plan, you have 20 connections limit (https://addons.heroku.com/heroku-postgresql).
You will need to tweak your setup so that it will use at most 20 connections.
(Sidekiq workers can use databse too, so don't forget to subtract it.)

    2 dynos * 2 workers * 5 thread   = 20 connections (pool is 5)
    1 dyno  * 2 workers * 10 threads = 20 connections (pool is 10)
    1 dyno  * 1 worker  * 20 threads = 20 connections (pool is 20)
    ...

## Experiment

    $ git clone <this-repo>
    $ cd <this-repo>
    $ bundle
    $ rake db:create
    $ rake s # to start server

Open another tab

    $ rake b # to start benchmark (wrk)

* Play with `min_threads`, `max_threads` and `workers` in `puma.rb`.
* Also play with `max_connections` in `app.rb`.
* Benchmark settings are in `Rakefile`.

Setting connection pool too low may cause `Sequel::PoolTimeout - Sequel::PoolTimeout` errors.

## Beware when using more workers (processes)

When using multiple workers, you need to disconnect the connections from the pool
before the process fork occurs. This is done with `on_worker_boot` in Puma.
See `puma.rb`.

If you don't clear the pool, you might end up with `Sequel::DatabaseDisconnectError - PG::UnableToSend: socket not open`
and `Timeout::Error - execution expired` errors.

## Sidekiq

* Concurrency option: connection limit / sidekiq workers

If you are using Redis to Go Nano, then you have 10 connections limit (https://addons.heroku.com/redistogo).
And if you are using 1 (sidekiq) worker, then your `-c` option (concurrency) is 10. If 2 workers, then `-c` is 5.

    sidekiq -c 10 # if limit 10 and 1 worker
    sidekiq -c 5  # if limit 10 and 2 workers

If you are going to use 10 redis connections then you might be using 10 database connections
so make sure to subtract it from the database connection limit when calculating database
connection pool size for the web. Also don't forget to set database connection pool to
the `-c` option (ie. 10, 5â€¦) when Sidekiq workers load env code.

You might end up doing something like this:

    db = Sequel.connect(
      'postgres://localhost/sequel_test',
      max_connections: (ENV['DB_POOL_SIZE'] || 20).to_i
    )

And starting up Sidekiq with:

    DB_POOL_SIZE=10 sidekiq -c 10
    DB_POOL_SIZE=5 sidekiq -c 5
